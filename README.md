# DuxinOnline
An online platform consisting of a database, a NLP ai, and a search engine. R&amp;D Group of Duxin Studio(student club) of Sun-Yat Sen University deployed it in School of Mathematics, hoping it will help students with their study. But that's how I applied it, not why. Of course for fun.
Let me describe how this platform is expected to function. The first part of it is a database. We will give trusting people authority to upload data, including notes, exercises, papers. And they're asked to labeled data with certain keywords. The second part is a NLP ai, we are considering use ChatGLM. The third part is a search engine. 
They, as a whole, work like this: users ask questions-> NLP list probably keywords-> search engine seek for files in database -> NLP re-organize related data -> output answers and related files
This project is planned to be completed in September 2024. We'll gradually update all the src. However, considering we're a group of underguaduates majoring in math, there's a huge risk of failure.
